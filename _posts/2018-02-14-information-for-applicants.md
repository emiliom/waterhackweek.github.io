             For those who do not know Python or wish to improve their skills, we are organizing a <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry workshop Feb. 7-8, 2019 </a> on the University of Washington campus. There is no registration fee for this event. We will also provide guidance to participants on Python and other tools through self-guided study. 
             What to expect:
* Peer-learning collaborations
* New skills and tools, including the latest technology and software
* Personalized mentorship from professional data scientists
* Interdisciplinary applications of data tools
* Access to an interactive library of custom tutorials
* Dedicated time and space to explore new ideas.
