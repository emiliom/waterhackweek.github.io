Waterhackweek is a learning community: an open collaborative effort supported by a committed group of scientists experimenting with mobilizing community, new work environments, and creative tool building. We have a shared goal of making our scientific research useful and impactful on the future of critical water resources. Annual operations, including a signature training event in the last week of March, are supported by donation, volunteer and grant funding to provide services to the research community. Below, find multiple pathways to collaborate with Waterhackweek, lessons to apply to your own learning communities,and open opportunities. 
Include Waterhackweek in your Proposal 
There are ongoing opportunities to leverage funding and new partner expertise from the Waterhackweek Team based at the University of Washington and Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc (CUAHSI).  You may include services for cyberinfrastructure support, interactive-online tutorial instructor training, organizational support for your own hackweek, cyberseminars, contribute to participant travel grants, or lead your own hackweek educational model inspired event.  In this case, collaborating institution(s) would be collaborators on your proposal, included as funded personnel, and could help write proposal text.  Waterhackweek can be leveraged in proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other grants. We can also provide letters of support for proposals to other federal scientific research agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Defense (DoD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Energy (DoE), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).  
Here is some sample text that could be modified for a NSF  proposal:
NSF Letters of Collaboration are often required to say only the following:
If the proposal submitted by PI XX entitled "YY" is selected for funding by the NSF, it is my intent to collaborate as detailed in the Project Description or the Facilities, Equipment or Other Resources section of the proposal.
