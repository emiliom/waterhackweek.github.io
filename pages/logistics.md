## Travel

Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the  University of Washington Campus. The <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/route/40_100479"> Link light rail</a> is an easy, great way to get to the UW from the airport. It stops by the airport about every 5-15 minutes and has its fi nal stop at the UW campus, just a 15-minute walk from the venue. From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the  signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the  station before boarding. The fare cost is $2.75 which can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take  the train to the last stop (UW). Taxis and Uber/Lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for Uber/Lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.
